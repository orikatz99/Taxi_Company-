# Taxi Company - C++ ðŸš•ðŸš¦ðŸš–
**This is the first part of my final project for the C++ course, completed at Afeka College.** 

In this part, we were required to choose a topic and build a system to manage it.  
We chose "Taxi Company Management."  

In this part, we only needed to define the system's attributes, create the story, and write all the header files without implementing them.  
Additionally, we had to implement a main function.
